ISO Class standards outline a higher degree of micron level particulates starting at 0.1 micron, while FS 209E references a standard particle diameter of 0.5 micron. It should be noted that these standards are easily confused, sometimes even in manufacturer spec sheets — a 'Class 1' (Fed. Standard) cleanroom has a particle threshold equivalent of an “ISO Class 3” (ISO Standard). Unless specifically noted as an “ISO” standard, one could assume that the US Fed. Standard 209E is being referenced, which was officially canceled by the General Services Administration of the US Dept. of Commerce November 29, 2001, but is still widely used."},
