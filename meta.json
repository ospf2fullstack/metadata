It's designed for indoor use such as painting or drywall work where you can easily move to the next section of your task, lock safely in place, then resume work with little delay. The entire rolling work platform is built from strong 1.5-in. square steel tubes that are powder coated to resist corrosion and prevent slippage. Steel-reinforced platforms, spring-loaded locks, and guardrails all provide increased safety for your workforce. It's easy to assemble and fully adjustable in 2-inch increments to get your scaffold tower to the desired height. Our baker-style scaffolding is ANSI certified and compliant with OSHA standards.Metaltech builds and designs practical, effective, efficient, and safe work equipment for office and home use. We strive to incorporate new technology and innovation into equipment and accessories that make sense, so you can get jobs done easily, safely, and on time.

It should be noted that these standards are easily confused, sometimes even in manufacturer spec sheets — a 'Class 1' (Fed. Standard) cleanroom has a particle threshold equivalent of an “ISO Class 3” (ISO Standard). Unless specifically noted as an “ISO” standard, one could assume that the US Fed.
